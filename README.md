# Second Project:
- Password_Strength_Checker is my second project given by Brainwave Matrix Solutions.

## Password Strength Checker:
- This is a python based tool designed to check password strength on the basis of characters variety, length and complexity.
  
## Overview:
- The password strength checker is designed to evaluate the strength of a given password based on various criteria  such as length, characters variety, and common password patterns. The checker provides feedback 
 on the password's strength and suggestions for improvement.

## Features:
- *This tool provides the feature of calculating password entropy and suggestion if given password is weak.
- *It automatically generates random password if given password is weak.
